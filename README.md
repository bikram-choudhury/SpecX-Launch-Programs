## General architecture

This app has entrypoint for the code `src/index.js` first checks if the current browser needs to be polyfilled and then defers to src/main.js to hydrate the React application. These two files are only ever called on the client, so you can safely reference any browser APIs here without anything fancy. The rest of the client code is a React application. You can edit/modify everything inside src/ and make it your own.

This app has been develpoed with all latest react hooks like: `useEffect(), useCallback(), memo(), useHistory()`.
